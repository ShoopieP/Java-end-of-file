//problem

//You are given a class Solution with a main method. Complete the given code so that it outputs the area of a parallelogram with breadth  and height . You should read the variables from the standard input.
//If B<=0 or H<=0 , the output should be "java.lang.Exception: Breadth and height must be positive" without quotes.

//solution

//1. loop to check if both value for B and H are greater than 0, if not print
//"java.lang.Exception: Breadth and height must be positive"

//once check passes do base x height for parraleloram area
